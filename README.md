Project 1: Big data through relational database storage
The focus of this assignment is on the exploration of design considerations for storage of
big data using relational databases. Through this project we will explore:
1. Approaches in expanding storage of a relational database to support large data
sets (a.k.a. big data)
2. Evaluation of direct JDBC and ORM-based approaches, performance, and
scalability
3. ETL loading strategies
Role & Background
You are part of the R&D team for AltoCloud, a company specializing in providing public
access to meteorological data and analysis services. Your assignment is to look at designs
to support large and long-term storage for a large data repository. This effort will provide
a feasibly study to determine the suitability of a relational-based design for a proposed
cloud storage for world-wide weather data.
Data
A script is provide with a sample data file for your use. While an aspect of this project is
related to the past 275 project, it is not the 275 project; we are focusing on the data and
data storage. I would appreciate if those that are familiar with this data, will provide
assistance to other students.
Deliverables
1. The project is to completed and submitted +/- 2 days of the due date as noted on
the class schedule.
2. Standard deliverables apply (in one archive file)
a. Complete source code
b. Project write-up (design, analysis, conclusions, references)
c. build.xml
d. Installation and test instructions
e. Additional details will be provided
